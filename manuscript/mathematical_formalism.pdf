# Mathematical Interpretation of A/R Particle Framework

This document provides a mathematical summary of the key equations in Ashebo's Emergent Gravity Theory, focusing on the A/R particle framework.

## Core Equations

The effective gravitational parameter is given by:

G_eff = G₀·A·R

Where:
- G₀ is the base gravitational constant
- A represents baryon asymmetry (9.15×10⁻⁹ for Earth-like conditions)
- R represents symmetry restoration (7.29×10⁻³ for Earth-like conditions)

## Field Equations

The dynamical fields for A and R particles follow:

∇²A - ∂²A/∂t² = ρₘ
∇²R - ∂²R/∂t² = -ρₑ

Where:
- ρₘ represents mass density
- ρₑ represents energy density

## Fusion Core Dynamics

The fusion rate in celestial bodies is proportional to:

F ∝ R³·A

This explains the transition from Earth-like to Sun-like conditions as R increases from 7.29×10⁻³ to 7.29×10⁰.

## Mass-Energy Relationship

The relationship between mass (M) and energy (E) in this framework:

M = M₀(1 + k·A·R)
E = E₀(1 + j·A·R)

Where k and j are coupling constants.
