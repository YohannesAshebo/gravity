# A/R Particle Framework Summary

This document provides a concise summary of the A/R particle framework in Ashebo's Emergent Gravity Theory.

## Key Concepts

### A Particles (Asymmetry)
- Hydrogen-sized particles flowing inward toward massive bodies
- Represent spacetime curvature/asymmetry
- Initial value: 9.15×10⁻⁹ for Earth-like conditions
- Maximum value: 9.15×10⁻⁶ for Sun-like conditions

### R Particles (Restoration)
- Smaller than hydrogen, flowing outward from massive bodies
- Represent symmetry restoration
- Initial value: 7.29×10⁻³ for Earth-like conditions
- Maximum value: 7.29×10⁰ for Sun-like conditions

## Interaction Effects

1. **Gravitational Effect**
   - Product A×R determines gravitational strength
   - Earth-like conditions: A×R = 6.7×10⁻¹¹
   - Sun-like conditions: A×R = 1.255×10⁻⁶

2. **Fusion Process**
   - Core fusion limited by Pauli exclusion principle
   - Fusion intensity increases with R value
   - Transitions from reddish (Earth-like) to yellow (Sun-like)

3. **Mass Accumulation**
   - Initially increases with higher R values
   - Eventually decreases as fusion overtakes accumulation
   - Sun has 333,000× Earth's mass at maximum values

4. **Gravity Scaling**
   - Increases with A value
   - Sun has 28× Earth's surface gravity at maximum values
